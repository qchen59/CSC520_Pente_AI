# CSC520 Pente AI
Group Members: Qiuyu Chen, Hugh Wright, Yasitha Rajapaksha, Jiacheng Yang

This is a repository for our final project. It creates a Pente AI using Alpha Beta Pruning and Monte Carlo Tree Search, using a wide variety of heuristics. To play against the AI, use the GUI.py script. This requires the PyQt5 python library.
